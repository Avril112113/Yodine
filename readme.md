# Yodine
Pronounced Yo-Dine ('Yo-d-eye-ne'?)

# Github Repo Info
This is put on github for help from others  
but you may use it as you wish for your own projects.  

Just do not take ownership of what is not yours. (i should add a licence but idk how they work)  

# The project
This is made to attempt at emulating a data network from the game StarBase (not out yet)  
its a 2D editor not 3D (as of right now)  

This is heavily work in progress but feedback is always nice.  

Until this project is at a more usable state it might be quite messy, Sorry.

# grammar.relabel
When editing the grammar i made a vscode extension for fancy colors  
When i get my desktop PC back in the UK i will add my vscode extension for syntax highlighting the grammar file  

# The DLL (lepglabel.dll)
Its just `LPegLabel` compiled for LuaJIT  
If you don't trust it then feel free to compile it your self (https://github.com/sqmedeiros/lpeglabel)  
or if you have luarocks and it works for LuaJIT then you can use luarocks  

# /reference
This folder only contains files i used for reference  
the file 'should' contain some name somewhere of who its from
