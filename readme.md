# Github Repo Info
This is put on github for help from others  
but when its done you may use it as you wish for your own projects.  

Just do not take ownership of what is not yours. (i should add a licence but idk how they work)  

# grammar.relabel
When editing the grammar i made a vscode extension for fancy colors  
When i get my desktop PC back in the UK i will add my vscode extention for syntax highlighting the grammar file  

# The DLL (lepglabel.dll)
Was a mistake, but its there now  
Its just `LPegLabel` compiled for LuaJIT  
If you don't trust it then compile it your self  

# /reference
This folder only contains files i used for reference  
the file 'should' contain some name somewhere of who its from
