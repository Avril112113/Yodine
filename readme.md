Pronounced Yo-Dine as in, 'going to a dinner'

# The project
Yodine is a 2D editor and emulates [StarBase](https://store.steampowered.com/app/454120/Starbase/)s data network system and yolol programming language.  
The project is still under development so expect bugs and errors (please report them).
